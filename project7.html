  <h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
<p class="place-description">If I could visit anywhere in the world I would want to visit Paris, France. I chose this place because I have always wanted to see the Eiffel Tower up close ever since I was little. </p>

  <h2>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2> 
<p class="person-description">A person that I admire would be my mom. I admire my mom because she is a hard worker and she is always determined when she sets her mind to something. She also knows how to cheer me up when I get down.</p>
